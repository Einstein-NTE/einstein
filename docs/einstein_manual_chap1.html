Newcomers<br>
</span></h2>
Note: V1.00a is still an INTERNAL testing version !!!<br>
<br>
If You already have successfully installed EINSTEIN V.001 (demo version
of the Sabadell meeting) please <a
 href="#1.2._Update_from_previous_Versions_">jump to section 1.2</a>.<br>
<br>
<h3>1.1.1. Basic set-up previous to the installation of EINSTEIN<br>
</h3>
Einstein uses the following software packages that have to be installed
PREVIOUSLY to the installation of EINSTEIN itself :<br>
- MySQL (Version 5.0 or higher)<br>
- Python (Version 2.5 or higher)<br>
- Several Python complements: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) wxPython<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) matplotlib<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) numpy<br>
<br>
HOW TO INSTALL THESE PACKAGES ?<br>
<br>
Step 1: Create your einstein installation folder, e.g. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">C:\MyEINSTEIN</span>.<br>
<br>
Step 2: Copy the following files into C:\MyEINSTEIN and then unzip, in
the order as specified (the second file will overwrite some of the old
files. When asked, confirm overwriting files with OK):<br>
- EINSTEIN_InternalRelease_001.zip (-&gt; the installation package of
the very first Meeting-Sabadell-Demo Installation)<br>
- EINSTEIN_R1.00a.zip<br>
<br>
Please CHECK: After this you should have (at least) the following files
and folders in your "MyEINSTEIN" directory:<br>
- EINSTEIN.bat<br>
- install_mysql.bat<br>
- install_python.bat<br>
- install_einstein.bat<br>
- check_Installation.bat<br>
- folder "einstein"<br>
- folder "installer"<br>
<br>
Step 3: Set-up of MySQL (skip if you have already MySQL 5.0 or higher
running, skip this section)<br>
<br>
TAKE CARE: Uninstall any older Version of MySQL BEFORE installing the
new Version !!! Parallel installation of two different MySQL Versions
may lead to problems.<br>
<br>
There are two possible ways to doing MySQL installation. We recomment
use of the installer (option (a) ), but in case of any problem you can
try it with option (b).<br>
<br>
a) Run the file "install_mysql.bat" and follow the instructions given
on the screen (NOTE: internet connection is necessary !!!)<br>
<br>
b) go to: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html and download
the Windows ZIP/Setup.EXE (x86) <br>
(or one of the other versions, depending on your computer and operating
system)<br>
<br>
CHECK OF MySQL INSTALLATION (On Windows)<br>
<br>
To check the correct installation of MySQL, You can open the Control
Panel, and look for an icon called Administrative Tools. <br>
Open that, and there is another icon called Services. Open that too. <br>
You will see a list of programs running in your machine. The list is
ordered alphabetically. <br>
Look for MySQL. It should be marked as Running (or Initiated or
something like that) and in the next column, it should be marked as
Automatic.
<br>
These settings ensure that MySQL is started each time you start your
computer.<br>
If it is there, but not running, click on the line with the Right
button and choose Start. This will start MySQL, but only this once. <br>
To make it start always, choose Properties. There you can select
Automatic.
<br>
If MySQL refuses to run, please first deinstall and then reinstall it.
<br>
<br>
Step 4: Set-up of&nbsp; Python and complements<br>
<br>
There are two possible ways to doing Python installation. We recomment
use of the installer (option (a) ), but in case of any problem you can
try it with option (b).<br>
<br>
a) Run the file "install_python.bat" and follow the instructions given
on the screen (NOTE: internet connection is necessary !!!)<br>
<br>
b) Go to www.python.org/download and do it yourself.<br>
<br>
The installers for the necessary complements you find at:<br>
<br>
http://www.wxpython.org/<br>
numpy: http://numpy.scipy.org/<br>
matplotlib: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/<br>
<br>
Install also these additional packages on your computer.<br>
<br>
Step 5: Check Your Firewall<br>
<br>
Do you have a firewall on your machine? <br>
If so, you should free port 3306, which is used by MySQL
<br>
<br>
==&gt; HOW CAN I DO THAT?
<br>
<br>
(EXTRACTS&nbsp; FROM E-MAILS REGARDING FIREWALL PROBLEMS ... to be
checked ...)<br>
In general firewalls have an icon on the bottom right part of your
desktop. It says 'security' or 'firewall' or something like that. <br>
When you open it, there usually is some button called 'advanced
settings' or something. A precise answer to your question would depend
on what firewall do you have installed.
<br>
<br>
I think that this is a very concrete and simple matter that you might
submit to the people that give technical support at your institution.
They will certainly know.
<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
And, if it is not a problem with the firewall, please try this:
<br>
Open a command window and write the command:
<br>
<br>
NET START mysql
<br>
<br>
This should show a more descriptive error diagnostic.

of EINSTEIN<br>
</h3>
Step 1: Installation of the EINSTEIN database<br>
<br>
There are two possible ways to doing the EINSTEIN database
installation. We recomment
use of the installer (option (a) ), but in case of any problem you can
try it with option (b).<br>
<br>
a) Run the file "install_einsteinDB.bat" and follow the instructions
given on the screen.<br>
<br>
b) Run EINSTEIN (see below) and use the Menu-Option: <br>
<br>
Database -&gt; Database Administration -&gt; Restore Database<br>
<br>
You should select the file "einstein_R1.00a.sql" in the folder
&lt;MyEINSTEIN&gt;\einstein\sql<br>
<br>
Step 2: Now have a try -&gt; Run EINSTEIN<br>
<br>
For any problems check the <a href="einstein_manual_FAQs.html">FAQ
Section</a> of this manual.<br>
<br>
Step 3: Configuration of MySQL password:<br>
If you configured MySQL with a password, you have to specify this
password in the Einstein configuration:<br>
<br>
There are two possibilities<br>
a) edit manually the file einstein\GUI\einstein.ini and put the
password there. You will see that there is no password, originally.
<br>
<br>
b) Use the option&nbsp; "Database -&gt; Database Administration" in
EINSTEIN, and enter your password there.<br>
<br>

<h2><a name="1.2._Update_from_previous_Versions_"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">1.2. Update from previous Versions<br>
</span></h2>
Step 1:&nbsp; You can use your existing EINSTEIN installation folder,
e.g. <span style="font-weight: bold;">C:\&lt;MyEINSTEIN&gt;</span> ,
or you can create a new one, e.g. <span style="font-weight: bold;">C:\&lt;MyEINSTEIN
V1.00a&gt;<br>
<br>
</span>Step 2: Copy the file "EINSTEIN_R1.00a.zip" into
C:\&lt;MyEINSTEIN&gt; and then unzip. <br>
(if you use the folder of an existing installation, this may overwrite
some of the old
files. When asked, confirm overwriting files with OK).<br>
<br>
Please CHECK: After this you should have (at least) the following files
and folders in your "MyEINSTEIN" directory:<br>
- EINSTEIN.bat<br>
- install_einsteinDB.bat<br>
- folder "einstein"<br>
<br>
Step 3: Install the update of the EINSTEIN database (<a
 href="#1.1.2._Installation_of_EINSTEIN_">-&gt; section 1.1.2</a>)<br>
<br>
Step 4: Now have a try -&gt; Run EINSTEIN<br>
