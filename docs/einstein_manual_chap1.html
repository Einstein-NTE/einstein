</span></h2>
If You already have successfully installed some of the preliminary
versions of EINSTEIN V1.00a or V1.00b please <a
 href="#1.2._Update_from_previous_Versions_">jump to section 1.2</a>.<br>
<br>
<h3>1.1.1. Basic set-up previous to the installation of EINSTEIN<br>
</h3>
Einstein uses the following software packages that have to be installed
PREVIOUSLY to the installation of EINSTEIN itself :<br>
- MySQL (Version 5.1 or higher)<br>
- Python (Version 2.5 or higher)<br>
- Several Python complements: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) wxPython<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) matplotlib<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) numpy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) MySQL-Python<br>
<br>
HOW TO INSTALL THESE PACKAGES ?<br>
<br>
Step 1: Create your einstein installation folder, e.g. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">C:\MyEINSTEIN</span>.<br>
<br>
Step 2: Copy the following files into C:\MyEINSTEIN and then unzip:<br>
- EINSTEIN_1.0.zip<br>
- MySQLandPython.zip<br>
<br>
Please CHECK: After this you should have (at least) the following files
and folders in your "MyEINSTEIN" directory:<br>
- EINSTEIN.bat<br>
- install_mysql.bat<br>
- install_python.bat<br>
- install_einstein.bat<br>
- check_Installation.bat<br>
- folder "einstein"<br>
- folder "installer"<br>
<br>
Step 3: Set-up of MySQL (skip if you have already MySQL 5.1 or higher
running, skip this section)<br>
<br>
TAKE CARE: Uninstall or deactivate any older Version of MySQL BEFORE
installing the
new Version !!! <br>
Parallel installation of two different MySQL Versions
may lead to problems.<br>
IMPORTANT: if You already had an old version of MySQL installed, after
uninstalling You should also delete manually the remaining files named
"mysql" on your computer.<br>
Those are usually the following (in WINDOWS installations):<br>
C:\Program Files\mysql<br>
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\mysql<br>
C:\Doucments and Settings\&lt;Individual User's Name&gt;\Application
Data\mysql<br>
<br>
There are two possible ways to doing MySQL installation. We recomment
use of the installer (option (a) ), but in case of any problem you can
try it with option (b).<br>
<br>
a) Run the file "install_mysql.bat" and follow the instructions given
on the screen<br>
<br>
VERY IMPORTANT: <br>
Choose all the default options offered by the MySQL installer except
the following (in the order that they appear):<br>
- select the option Port Number 3306: "add firewall exception for this
port"<br>
- select the option: include bin-directory in Windows Path<br>
- UNselect the option: modify security settings (so that You can
install MySQL without password)<br>
<br>
b) go to: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html and download
the Windows ZIP/Setup.EXE (x86) <br>
(or one of the other versions, depending on your computer and operating
system)<br>
<br>
Take care of activating / deactivating the MySQL configuration settings
as specified under (a)<br>
<br>
CHECK OF MySQL INSTALLATION (On Windows)<br>
<br>
To check the correct installation of MySQL, You can open the Control
Panel, and look for an icon called Administrative Tools. <br>
Open that, and there is another icon called Services. Open that too. <br>
You will see a list of programs running in your machine. The list is
ordered alphabetically. <br>
Look for MySQL. It should be marked as Running (or Initiated or
something like that) and in the next column, it should be marked as
Automatic.
<br>
These settings ensure that MySQL is started each time you start your
computer.<br>
If it is there, but not running, click on the line with the Right
button and choose Start. This will start MySQL, but only this once. <br>
To make it start always, choose Properties. There you can select
Automatic.
<br>
If MySQL refuses to run, please first deinstall and then reinstall it.
<br>
<br>
Step 4: Set-up of&nbsp; Python and complements<br>
<br>
There are two possible ways to doing Python installation. We recomment
use of the installer (option (a) ), but in case of any problem you can
try it with option (b).<br>
<br>
a) Run the file "install_python.bat" and follow the instructions given
on the screen<br>
<br>
b) Go to www.python.org/download and do it yourself.<br>
<br>
The installers for the necessary complements you find at:<br>
<br>
wxPython: <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">http://www.wxpython.org/</a><br>
numpy: <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">http://numpy.scipy.org/</a><br>
matplotlib: <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/</a><br>
<span class="moz-txt-link-freetext">MySQL-Python: </span><a
 class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22307">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22307</a>
<br>
<br>
Install also these additional packages on your computer.<br>
<br>
Step 5: Check Your Firewall<br>
<br>
Do you have a firewall on your machine? <br>
If so, you should free port 3306, which is used by MySQL
<br>
<br>
==&gt; HOW CAN I DO THAT?
<br>
<br>
In general firewalls have an icon on the bottom right part of your
desktop. It says 'security' or 'firewall' or something like that. <br>
When you open it, there usually is some button called 'advanced
settings' or something. <br>
A precise answer to your question would depend
on what firewall do you have installed.
<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
If there are problems with MySQL but it is not a problem with the
firewall, please try this:
<br>
Open a command window and write the command:
<br>
<br>
NET START mysql
<br>
<br>
This should show a more descriptive error diagnostic.
<br>
<br>
Step 6: Check Your Anti-Virus configuration<br>
<br>
Some Anti-Virus software, like e.g. McAfee may cause problems in
combination with the MySQL database server.<br>
MySQL creates some temporary files in the folder C:\Windows\Temp, and
some antivirus software does not allow MySQL to delete these temporary
files.<br>
This can be solved excluding the folder C:\Windows\Temp from real-time
scanning in the Antivirus (in McAfee: option All Processes / detection
/ exclusions). <br>

of EINSTEIN<br>
</h3>
Step 1: Installation of the EINSTEIN database<br>
<br>
There are two possible ways to doing the EINSTEIN database
installation. We recomment
use of the installer (option (a) ), but in case of any problem you can
try it with option (b).<br>
<br>
a) Run the file "<span style="font-weight: bold;">install_einsteinDB.bat</span>"
and follow the instructions
given on the screen.<br>
<br>
b) Run EINSTEIN (see below) and use the Menu-Option: <br>
<br>
Database -&gt; Database Administration -&gt; Restore Database<br>
<br>
You should select the file "einstein_V1.0.sql" in the folder
&lt;MyEINSTEIN&gt;\einstein\sql<br>
<br>
Step 2: Now have a try -&gt; Run EINSTEIN<br>
<br>
For any problems check the <a href="einstein_manual_FAQs.html">FAQ
Section</a> of this manual.<br>
<br>
Step 3: Configuration of MySQL password:<br>
If you configured MySQL with a password, you have to specify this
password in the Einstein configuration:<br>
<br>
There are two possibilities<br>
a) edit manually the file einstein\GUI\einstein.ini and put the
password there. You will see that there is no password, originally.
<br>
<br>
b) Use the option&nbsp; "Database -&gt; Database Administration" in
EINSTEIN, and enter your password there.<br>
NOTE: you have to specify the folder where the executables of MySQL are
located <br>
(typically something like C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.1\bin)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<h2><a name="1.2._Update_from_previous_Versions_"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">1.2. Update from previous Versions<br>
</span></h2>
Step 1:&nbsp; You can use your existing EINSTEIN installation folder,
e.g. <span style="font-weight: bold;">C:\&lt;MyEINSTEIN&gt;</span> ,
or you can create a new one, e.g. <span style="font-weight: bold;">C:\&lt;MyEINSTEIN
V1.0&gt;<br>
<br>
</span>Step 2: Copy the file "EINSTEIN_V1.0.zip" into
C:\&lt;MyEINSTEIN&gt; and then unzip. <br>
(if you use the folder of an existing installation, this may overwrite
some of the old
files. When asked, confirm overwriting files with OK).<br>
<br>
Please CHECK: After this you should have (at least) the following files
and folders in your "MyEINSTEIN" directory:<br>
- EINSTEIN.bat<br>
- install_einsteinDB.bat<br>
- folder "einstein"<br>
<br>
Step 3: Install the update of the EINSTEIN database (<a
 href="#1.1.2._Installation_of_EINSTEIN_">-&gt; section 1.1.2</a>).<br>
<br>
TAKE CARE: If You have a previous installation of EINSTEIN running on
your computer and do not want to lose the data in your database, you
should NOT carry out the database installation, as this will overwrite
existing data !!!<br>
<br>
For updating your database STRUCTURE to Version 1.0 without losing data
you can do it by several ways:<br>
<br>
a) run the file "<span style="font-weight: bold;">update_einsteinDB.bat</span>"<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
b) by hand:<br>
<br>
Open the MS-DOS command shell on your computer.<br>
<br>
enter in the folder<br>
&lt;MyEinstein&gt;\einstein\sql<br>
<br>
Type the following<br>
<br>
mysql ----host=localhost --user=&lt;username&gt;
--password=&lt;password&gt; &lt; update_einsteinDB_V1.00b_to_V1.0.sql<br>
(if you have a password specified on mysql)<br>
<br>
or<br>
mysql ----host=localhost --user=&lt;username&gt;&nbsp; &lt;
update_einsteinDB_V1.00b_to_V1.0.sql<br>
(without password)<br>
<br>
where<br>
&lt;username&gt; is your username on the mysql server (by default: root)<br>
&lt;password&gt; is your password on mysql<br>
<br>
if you get the error message "mysql not found", then you have first to
add MySQL to the PATH on your computer:<br>
<br>
set PATH = PATH; "C:\&lt;path to your mysql
installation&gt;\MySQL\MySQL Server5.1\bin"<br>
<br>
<br>
Step 4: Now have a try -&gt; Run EINSTEIN<br>
